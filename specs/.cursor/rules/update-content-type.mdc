This rule outlines how to run a "Content Model Create/Update Workflow"

- check all staged files inside the specs/ folder
- Find any new files that have been created
- every file represents a content model in contentful
- use the create_content_type tool to create a content type based on each spec file
- to create a content type using the create_content_type tool, first prepare the payload config object by reviewing the spec. IMPORTANT: make sure to follow the spec exactly!
- once the content type has been created, publish the content type using the publish_content_type tool
- finally, use the get_content_type tool to fetch the created content type and verify that it was created successfully. verify by comparing the output of the get_content_type tool with what the spec says.
